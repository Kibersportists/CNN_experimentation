Here are the files I created during the learning process of python basics. The purpose of this repository is mainly for me to review the content again after some time has passed, allowing me to refresh my understanding of the basics.

Files were created based on a youtube tutorial "Image Classification with Neural Networks in Python" available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0EzVCvQjGE&ab_channel=NeuralNine
